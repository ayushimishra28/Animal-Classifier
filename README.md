# Animal-Classifier
I have build a model with 90% that can identify 10 animals[butterfly, cat, cock, cow, dog, elephant, horse, sheep, spider, squirrel] 

You can find dataset here https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10

It contains about 28K medium quality animal images belonging to 10 categories: dog, cat, horse, spyder, butterfly, cicken, sheep, cow, squirrel, elephant. Image count for each category varies from 2K to 5 K units.


There are two notebooks:

Animal Classifier.ipynb : In this I have categorize data and build the model. As the dataset is large so the deep learning model takes lot of time to train. So I have saved the model as model.json.

Animal Classifier Prediction.ipynb : This notebook is for prediction by loading the model.
